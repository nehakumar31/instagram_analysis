# Sentiment Analysis
1. Trains a model with input as labelled Comments.
2. Target class has 4 categories: <br>
   Positive => Comment like "howw stunning ðŸŒºðŸŒºðŸŒºðŸŒºðŸŒºðŸŒºðŸŒºðŸŒº"<br>
               All requests are considered as positive. Comment like "please bring back pearberry" as they indicate user's interest in that brand<br>
               All inquiries are considered as positive. Comment like "with the aroma therapy prods be on sale too?" as they are indication os user's interest<br>
   Negative => Comment like "pathetic delivery and broken products"<br>
   Neutral => Comment like "ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®" as this is not an indicative of surprise positive/negative<br>
              Comment like "magic charmer ðŸ’«"<br>
   Mixed => Comments having both good and bad/sarcasm like "this dress is beautiful. the new reboot is terrible." <br>
   
   End user would have to focus on labels - Negative and Mixed to work on improvement strategies. 
3. Metric used for evaluation is weighted f1-score to get balance of precision and recall considering imbalance too.
